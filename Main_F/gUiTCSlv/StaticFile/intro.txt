    There are many things in our surrounding, many of them are unknown to us and some of them are known to us out of which some are easy accessable and accessing to some is difficult.Out of availability of our surronding some are absolutly arranged in their combination, some are just presented to us, and some are for us to arrange them well to make sufficent and easy access. In this work we have tried to make easy access by creating a well arrangement of avaliables which is new for us at this stage.
    
    In this work we have written C-code for some models of Finte Automata. 
    Intracting with a program like providing input to program and collecting/reading output in Command Based User Interface(CUI) is not easier for all; because every character, symbol and there cases are sensitive in command code and apart from this we have to remember all these commands. We have tried to reduce this problem for which we have created a Graphicial User Interface(GUI).

    Our GUI facilitates us to write inpute manualy for selected program and it renders output on screen; it also saves output in file for later analysis. Our GUI facilitates us provide input manually or analyse the output of random valide input generated by Java Code written for option "Random Input" in front*end code.
